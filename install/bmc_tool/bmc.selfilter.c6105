# SEL Filter file -- this is read by the "bmc" tool
#
# The format is:
#
# severity , rule
# 
#   severity can be:  ignore, info, warn, or crit
#   rule is a text string to match inside a SEL line (from "ipmitool sel list")
#
#   rules can contain a logical AND delimeter to require multiple parts to match:  {{&&}}
#
# NOTE:  SEL entries not covered by a rule is assumed to be critical, and will get severity
# 'crit' (lower case) to indicate this.  
#
# sev     meaning
# 
# CRIT    Matched rule; critical severity
# WARN    Matched rule; warning severity
# INFO    Matched rule; info severity
# XXXX    Matched rule; 'ignore' severity
# crit    Did not match any rule; treated as critical; written differently to alert the user
#         so that rules can be amended
